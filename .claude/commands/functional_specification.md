## Step 1: Check Prerequisites

Check that there is a solution_specification.md  and a goal-design.json with state finished in the respective folder.


- DO NOT CREATE THEM all at once; the process is incremental as the user commands it, one by one.

ALWAYS ask for feedback and corrections from the user before moving to the next steps.

## Step 2: Build mission-statement.json

- For each mission stament there must be a list of [assumptions](../GLOSARY.md) 

Follow docs/functional/mission-stament.md in detail.

**Expected output**

It must be a JSON file conforming to mission-statement.schema.json:

mission-statement.json


## Step 3: Build function-refinement-tree.json

Follow docs/functional/function-refinement-tree.md in detail.

**Expected output**

It must be a JSON file conforming to function-refinement-tree.schema.json:

function-refinement-tree.json


## Step 3: Build stimulus-response-list.md

- Follow docs/functional/stimulus-response-list.md in detail
  
Produce the list of events

## Step 4: Build service-descriptions.md
